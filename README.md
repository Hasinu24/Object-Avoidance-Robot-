# Object-Avoidance-Robot-
This repository contains the implementation of an Autonomous Finite State Machine (AFSM) for a robot that can autonomously navigate its environment while avoiding obstacles. The robot integrates multiple behaviors, such as line following, obstacle detection, and recovery, to dynamically respond to its surroundings.
